    Activities:
        Download and install Kafka on your machine.
        Set up Zookeeper (required for managing Kafka brokers).
        Start a Kafka broker and create a topic.
        Use the command-line tools (kafka-topics.sh, kafka-console-producer.sh, kafka-console-consumer.sh) to produce and consume messages.
    Outcome: You should be able to run Kafka locally and interact with it through basic command-line operations.

Day 5-6: Producing and Consuming Messages

    Goal: Learn how to produce and consume messages programmatically.
    Activities:
        Write a simple Java application that produces messages to a Kafka topic using the Kafka Producer API.
        Write a simple Java application that consumes messages from a Kafka topic using the Kafka Consumer API.
        Explore key concepts like key, value, partition, and offset in the context of producers and consumers.
        Experiment with different partitioning strategies and understand how Kafka handles message ordering.
    Outcome: You should be comfortable writing simple Kafka producer and consumer applications.

Day 7-8: Kafka Internals and Configuration

    Goal: Dive deeper into Kafka’s internal mechanics and configuration.
    Activities:
        Learn how Kafka stores and manages data in topics and partitions.
        Explore the concept of consumer groups and how Kafka achieves load balancing among consumers.
        Understand the importance of replication and how Kafka ensures data durability and fault tolerance.
        Experiment with configuring Kafka (e.g., adjusting retention policies, changing the number of partitions, etc.).
    Outcome: You should have a good understanding of how Kafka works under the hood and how to configure it for different scenarios.

Day 9-10: Working with Kafka Streams

    Goal: Learn how to process streams of data using Kafka Streams.
    Activities:
        Understand the basics of stream processing and how Kafka Streams fit into the Kafka ecosystem.
        Write a simple Kafka Streams application to process and transform data in real-time.
        Explore key concepts like KStream, KTable, and State Stores.
        Experiment with stateless and stateful transformations.
    Outcome: You should be able to create basic Kafka Streams applications for processing real-time data.

Day 11-12: Kafka Connect

    Goal: Learn how to integrate Kafka with other systems using Kafka Connect.
    Activities:
        Understand the role of Kafka Connect in integrating Kafka with external systems (databases, file systems, etc.).
        Set up Kafka Connect with a source connector to ingest data from an external system into Kafka.
        Set up a sink connector to push data from Kafka to another system.
        Explore how Kafka Connect handles schema evolution and data transformation.
    Outcome: You should be able to configure and use Kafka Connect to integrate Kafka with other systems.

Day 13-14: Kafka Monitoring and Management

    Goal: Learn how to monitor and manage a Kafka cluster.
    Activities:
        Explore the different metrics that Kafka exposes and how to monitor them using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
        Learn about Kafka management tools like Kafka Manager, Confluent Control Center, and how they help in managing Kafka clusters.
        Understand common Kafka issues (e.g., consumer lag, broker failure) and how to troubleshoot them.
    Outcome: You should be able to monitor and manage a Kafka cluster effectively.

Day 15-16: Kafka Security

    Goal: Understand Kafka security and how to secure your Kafka cluster.
    Activities:
        Learn about the security features Kafka provides (encryption, authentication, authorization).
        Set up SSL encryption for Kafka communication.
        Configure SASL for client authentication.
        Set up access control using ACLs (Access Control Lists).
    Outcome: You should have a good understanding of how to secure a Kafka cluster.

Day 17-18: Advanced Kafka Topics

    Goal: Dive into advanced Kafka topics for deeper understanding.
    Activities:
        Learn about Kafka’s exactly-once semantics and how to achieve it in your applications.
        Explore Kafka’s log compaction feature and understand when to use it.
        Understand how Kafka handles large-scale deployments with multi-cluster setups.
        Learn about Kafka Streams’ interactive queries and how to serve real-time data from Kafka Streams.
    Outcome: You should be comfortable with more advanced Kafka features and understand how to apply them.

Day 19-21: Building a Kafka Project

    Goal: Apply what you’ve learned by building a project using Kafka.
    Activities:
        Design and implement a real-world use case (e.g., a real-time analytics platform, event-driven microservices, etc.) using Kafka.
        Use Kafka Streams to process and analyze streaming data.
        Integrate Kafka with other systems using Kafka Connect.
        Implement monitoring and security for your Kafka project.
    Outcome: You should be able to design and implement a complete Kafka-based solution.

This plan is flexible, so you can adjust it based on your pace and the time you have available. Kafka is a powerful tool, and with consistent practice, you'll become proficient in it.
