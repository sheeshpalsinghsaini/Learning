Flexibility Tips:

    Prioritize Rest: If you ever feel too tired, prioritize sleep or relaxation over your learning sessions.
    Adjust Learning Sessions: If you find that one hour of learning is too long after work, consider splitting it into two 30-minute sessions—one before and one after the gym.
    Leisure Time: Use your weekend afternoons for activities you enjoy. This can help you recharge and stay motivated.
    Meal Prep: Consider preparing meals in bulk on weekends to save time during the week.

This schedule ensures that you have enough time to manage all your daily tasks, get adequate rest, and still make progress in learning new skills without feeling overwhelmed. Adjust the schedule as needed to suit your energy levels and personal preferences.
