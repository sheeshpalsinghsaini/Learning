Kibana and Elasticsearch are closely related but are not the same. Here's how they differ:
Elasticsearch:

    Purpose: Elasticsearch is a powerful search and analytics engine that allows you to store, search, and analyze large volumes of data in near real-time.
    Functionality:
        It is used to index and query data efficiently.
        Elasticsearch is part of the Elastic Stack, which also includes Logstash, Beats, and Kibana.
        It stores data in a document-based structure using JSON.
        It supports full-text search, structured search, and analytics across large datasets.
        Elasticsearch is often used for log and event data, application search, enterprise search, and more.

Kibana:

    Purpose: Kibana is a visualization and exploration tool for data stored in Elasticsearch.
    Functionality:
        Kibana provides a user interface to visualize Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack.
        It allows you to create dashboards, charts, maps, and other visualizations of your data.
        Kibana also offers features like monitoring, alerting, and machine learning to analyze and act on the data stored in Elasticsearch.
        It is often used for log analysis, monitoring, and data exploration.

Relationship Between Elasticsearch and Kibana:

    Integration: Kibana works on top of Elasticsearch. It queries the data stored in Elasticsearch and visualizes it in a user-friendly way.
    Use Case: While Elasticsearch is used for storing and querying data, Kibana is used for visualizing and interacting with that data.
    Elastic Stack: Both Kibana and Elasticsearch are part of the Elastic Stack (formerly known as the ELK Stack, which stands for Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana).

Summary:

    Elasticsearch is the engine that handles data storage, search, and analytics.
    Kibana is the interface that visualizes and interacts with the data stored in Elasticsearch.

They are different tools that work together within the Elastic Stack to provide a comprehensive solution for search, analysis, and visualization
