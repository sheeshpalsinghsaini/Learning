Day 9-10: Managing Docker Containers

    Goal: Get comfortable managing Docker containers.
    Activities:
        Learn to start, stop, restart, and remove containers using Docker CLI commands.
        Explore how to run containers in detached mode (-d) and how to attach to them.
        Understand port mapping (-p) and how to expose container services to your host machine.
        Experiment with environment variables and volumes to manage container configurations and persistent data.
    Outcome: You should be able to manage Docker containers effectively, including handling networking and storage.

Day 11-12: Docker Networking

    Goal: Understand how Docker networking works.
    Activities:
        Learn about Docker’s default bridge network and how containers communicate within it.
        Explore different Docker network drivers (bridge, host, overlay, etc.).
        Create custom networks and connect multiple containers within those networks.
        Experiment with DNS-based service discovery in Docker.
    Outcome: You should have a solid understanding of Docker networking and how to connect containers.

Day 13-14: Docker Volumes

    Goal: Learn how to manage data in Docker using volumes.
    Activities:
        Understand the difference between bind mounts and Docker-managed volumes.
        Learn how to create, mount, and manage Docker volumes.
        Experiment with sharing volumes between containers.
        Practice backing up and restoring data using volumes.
    Outcome: You should be comfortable managing persistent data in Docker using volumes.

Day 15-16: Docker Compose

    Goal: Learn how to define and run multi-container applications using Docker Compose.
    Activities:
        Install Docker Compose if it’s not already included in your Docker installation.
        Write a docker-compose.yml file to define a multi-container application.
        Use Docker Compose to start, stop, and manage the application (docker-compose up, docker-compose down).
        Learn about scaling services, defining networks, and using environment variables in Docker Compose.
    Outcome: You should be able to use Docker Compose to manage multi-container applications.

Day 17-18: Docker in Real-World Scenarios

    Goal: Apply Docker to real-world development and deployment scenarios.
    Activities:
        Explore how Docker is used in continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
        Learn how to use Docker for local development environments.
        Experiment with deploying a simple web application using Docker.
        Explore the use of Docker in microservices architectures.
    Outcome: You should understand how Docker is used in real-world development and deployment scenarios.

Day 19-20: Docker Security

    Goal: Learn about Docker security best practices.
    Activities:
        Understand the security risks associated with Docker containers.
        Learn about user management and running containers with least privilege.
