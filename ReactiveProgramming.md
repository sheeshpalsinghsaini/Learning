    Outcome: You should understand the basic building blocks of Project Reactor and how to create reactive streams.

Day 5-7: Operators and Transformations

    Goal: Get comfortable using various operators in Project Reactor.
    Activities:
        Study and practice with common operators like map, flatMap, filter, zip, and merge.
        Work on simple examples that transform and combine streams.
        Explore more advanced operators such as switchIfEmpty, defaultIfEmpty, and takeUntil.
        Understand backpressure and how operators handle it.
    Outcome: You should be able to manipulate reactive streams using various operators.

Day 8-10: Error Handling and Debugging

    Goal: Learn how to handle errors and debug reactive streams.
    Activities:
        Study different error handling strategies (onErrorReturn, onErrorResume, retry, etc.).
        Practice handling errors in a reactive pipeline.
        Use debugging tools and techniques provided by Reactor, such as log operator and checkpoint.
        Understand the importance of onComplete signals and how to handle stream completion.
    Outcome: You should be able to effectively manage errors and debug reactive streams.

Day 11-13: Working with Databases

    Goal: Integrate Reactive Programming with databases.
    Activities:
        Set up a reactive Spring Boot project with R2DBC.
        Work on CRUD operations using ReactiveCrudRepository.
        Learn how to handle transactions reactively.
        Explore non-blocking database operations and understand how they fit into a reactive pipeline.
    Outcome: You should be able to perform reactive database operations using Project Reactor.

Day 14-16: Combining and Composing Reactive Streams

    Goal: Master the composition of multiple streams.
    Activities:
        Learn about combining streams using zip, combineLatest, concat, etc.
        Practice composing streams for complex scenarios.
        Understand when to use parallel for concurrent processing.
        Explore scenarios like merging results from multiple API calls or combining data from multiple sources.
    Outcome: You should be able to handle complex scenarios by combining and composing reactive streams.

Day 17-19: Testing Reactive Streams

    Goal: Write and execute tests for reactive code.
    Activities:
        Learn how to test reactive streams using StepVerifier.
        Write tests for the various scenarios you've practiced so far.
        Understand how to assert time-based or delayed results in a reactive pipeline.
        Explore strategies for testing error handling and backpressure.
    Outcome: You should be confident in testing reactive streams and ensuring their correctness.

Day 20-21: Project Work and Review

    Goal: Apply your knowledge in a real project.
    Activities:
        Start a small project or contribute to an existing one using Project Reactor.
        Review and practice all the concepts you've learned.
        Reflect on areas that need more attention and revisit those topics.
        Consider learning more about advanced topics like schedulers, parallel processing, and custom operators.
    Outcome: You should be able to implement a reactive project with confidence and understand how to continue advancing your skills.

This plan covers the basics and intermediate topics in a structured manner. Adjust the pace based on your comfort level and the time you can dedicate each day. If you find certain topics challenging, feel free to spend extra time on them before moving forward.
